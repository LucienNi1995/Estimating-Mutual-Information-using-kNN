# Estimating-Mutual-Information-using-kNN
The project is focused on numerically estimating entropy and mutual information using k-th nearest neighbor estimators. For continuous estimators, KSG, BI-KSG and G-knn estimators were reproduced. For discrete case, Gaoâ€™s estimator and Multi-KL estimator were reproduced.
